# >> Hi, I'm Taisyu!

Thank you for your coming. I'm a ROS2 developer in Japan.

 
# Ongoing Projects

* [Autonomous control crawler](https://github.com/tstaisyu/crawler_teleop)  
It uses image recognition using a camera to follow people. 
  
(Development environment)  
OS: ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS   
ROS: Humble Hawksbill   
Language: C++, python  
  
  
# Works

・[Crawler by M5Stack Gray](https://github.com/tstaisyu/crawler_control_by_M5Stack_Gray)  
I ordered parts such as an aluminum frame and made the casing myself, using CuboRex's CuGo as a reference.
The main frames on both sides were carved from iron plates.
I also made a CFRP frame type.
For the controller, I wrote the code using Arduino on M5stack Gray and connected it to a Cytron motor driver.
  
・[Mini radio controlled car](https://github.com/tstaisyu/Mini-Autocar_by_M5Stack_Gray)
Obstacles and steps are detected by connecting an ultrasonic sensor and an illuminance proximity sensor to the M5stack Gray. [Reference](https://deviceplus.jp/mc-general/arduino-m5stack-remote-control-car-03/)
